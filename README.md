# HPC-Prototyping
This repository contains various projects for testing HPC technologies and algorithms.

## CUDA Unified Memory Experiments
### Calculate Pi
This experiment's goal is to write a function that can be used as a CUDA kernel, function that uses openmp or a serial version. The idea is to reuse as much code as possible and to be able to switch between CPU and GPU implementations by just changing one parameter in the CMakeLists file.


## Multi GPU Experiments
### Single Node Multiple GPU 
### Multiple Nodes Multiple GPU
