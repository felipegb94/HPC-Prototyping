To compile:
  module load cudatoolkit
  make
This will create a "hello" executable file, which uses MPI+CUDA

To remove executable and output files:
  make clean

Request an interactive job with 2 nodes, 16 processors per node,
and XK (for GPUs):
  qsub -I -l nodes=2:ppn=16:xk -l walltime=04:00:00

On the interactive job, run with 2 MPI processes, 1 per node:
  aprun -n 2 -N 1 ./hello
